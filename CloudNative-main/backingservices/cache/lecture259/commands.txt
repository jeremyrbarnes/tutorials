Uninstalling the Chart
To uninstall/delete the my-redis deployment:
Run Command:
helm uninstall redis
or
helm delete redis

These commands will uninstall the Helm charts and delete the associated Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Persistent Volume Claims. However, Persistent Volumes might not be deleted automatically depending on your setup, so you might want to check and delete them manually if needed.

>
Verify pods:
Run Command:
kubectl get pod

NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-2   1/1       Running   0          12s

kubectl get all

Stop the Cluster:
Run Command:

Also if you want to delete the Minikube cluster itself, 
	you can do so with the following command:

Run Command:
minikube delete

This will delete the Minikube cluster and all associated resources. You can start a new Minikube cluster again anytime with minikube start.
