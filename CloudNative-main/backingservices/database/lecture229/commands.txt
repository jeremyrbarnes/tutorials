Step 6. Stop the cluster
----

Github - CockroachDB Kubernetes Operator
	https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator

>
To shut down the CockroachDB cluster:

Delete the previously created custom resource:
Run Command:
kubectl delete -f example.yaml

>
Remove the Operator:
Run Command:
kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cockroachdb/cockroach-operator/v2.10.0/install/operator.yaml

This will delete the CockroachDB cluster being run by the Operator. It will not delete the persistent volumes that were attached to the pods.
