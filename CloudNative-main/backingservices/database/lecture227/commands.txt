Step 4. Access the DB Console

>>
To access database from DB Console, we need to create a user and password:
Create a user with a password:
Run Command:
CREATE USER roach WITH PASSWORD 'Q7gc8rEdS';

>>
To access the cluster's DB Console:
On secure clusters, certain pages of the DB Console can only be accessed by admin users.

Get a shell into the pod and start the CockroachDB built-in SQL client:
Run Command:
kubectl exec -it cockroachdb-client-secure -- ./cockroach sql --certs-dir=/cockroach/cockroach-certs --host=cockroachdb-public

Assign roach to the admin role (you only need to do this once):
Run Command:
GRANT admin TO roach;

Exit the SQL shell and pod:
\q

>
In a new terminal window, port-forward from your local machine to the cockroachdb-public service:
Run Command:
kubectl port-forward service/cockroachdb-public 8080

Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080

>
Go to https://localhost:8080 and log in with the username and password you created earlier.

USER: roach
PASSWORD: Q7gc8rEdS

>
In the UI, verify that the cluster is running as expected:

View the Node List to ensure that all nodes successfully joined the cluster.
Click the Databases tab on the left to verify that bank is listed.
