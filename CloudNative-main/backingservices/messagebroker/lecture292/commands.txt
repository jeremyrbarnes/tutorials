Uninstalling the Chart
To uninstall/delete the my-kafka deployment:
Run Command:
helm uninstall my-kafka
or
helm delete my-kafka

These commands will uninstall the Helm charts and delete the associated Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services, and Persistent Volume Claims. However, Persistent Volumes might not be deleted automatically depending on your setup, so you might want to check and delete them manually if needed.

>
Verify pods:
Run Command:
kubectl get pod

NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kafka-2   1/1       Running   0          12s
