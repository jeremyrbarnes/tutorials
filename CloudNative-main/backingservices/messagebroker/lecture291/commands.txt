See Github source code of helm chart:

>>
Run Command:
helm upgrade my-kafka bitnami/kafka --set replicaCount=3

>
Check the pods, and you should see the new pods starting up:

Run Command:
kubectl get pods

Now, you should see my-kafka-0, my-kafka-1 and my-kafka-2, all with status Running.

Simulate Redis Node Failures

Kubernetes ensures that three pods/nodes are running at all times. 
When a pod/node fails, Kubernetes automatically creates another pod/node with the same network identity and persistent storage.

To see this in action:
Watch Pods:
Run Command:
kubectl get pod --watch

Terminate one of the Kafka nodes:
Run Command:
kubectl delete pod my-kafka-2

pod "my-kafka-2" deleted

>>
Back in the terminal, verify that the pod was automatically restarted:

kubectl get pod

NAME            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-kafka-2   1/1       Running   0          12s
