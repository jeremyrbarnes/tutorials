See a list of all images available on your machine
	docker images

Run Docker image:
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name productservicecontainer productservice

---
Check if the container is running by executing:
docker ps

---
Open your browser and navigate to
http://localhost:8080

http://localhost:8080/api/products
[{"id":1,"name":"Product A","price":12.99},{"id":2,"name":"Product B","price":23.99},{"id":3,"name":"Product C","price":34.99}]

---
Stop Running Container:
docker stop productservicecontainer
docker rm productservicecontainer
docker ps

---
Another good approach to run docker image:
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:80 --name productservicecontainer productservice

This command tells Docker to run a container in -it interactive mode - we used also run detached mode (-d).

Hit Endpoint:
http://localhost:8080/api/products
[{"id":1,"name":"Product A","price":12.99},{"id":2,"name":"Product B","price":23.99},{"id":3,"name":"Product C","price":34.99}]

goto command prompt:
CTRL+C

Check running images on docker:
docker ps
