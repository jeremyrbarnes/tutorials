View Push Commands

>>
Follow Push Commands: Push Docker Image to Container Registry: 
Push the Docker image to a container registry like AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR). 


>1
Retrieve an authentication token and authenticate your Docker client to your registry.
Authenticate Docker to the Amazon ECR registry:
Use the AWS CLI:

aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-2 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com

Login Succeeded

Build your Docker image using the following command. For information on building a Docker file from scratch see the instructions here . You can skip this step if your image is already built:

>3
Tag your image:
After the build completes, tag your image so you can push the image to this repository:

docker tag productservice:latest xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/productservice:latest

See tagged image
PS C:\Users\PC> docker images
REPOSITORY                                                    TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/productservice   latest    50eb6f789c6d   8 minutes ago   213MB

Push it to ECR:
Run the following command to push this image to your newly created AWS repository:

docker push xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/productservice:latest

Takes 5 min
PS C:\Users\PC> docker push xxxxxxx.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/productservice:latest
