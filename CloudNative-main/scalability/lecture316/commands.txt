Step 1. Manually Horizontal and Vertical scaling pods into Kubernetes Cluster with Minikube 
----
>>
1: Start Minikube
Start Minikube by running the following command:
minikube start

>>
2: Deploy a sample application

For this lab, we will deploy a simple Nginx web server.
Create a deployment file named nginx-deployment.yaml:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: 500m
            memory: 128Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 250m
            memory: 64Mi
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

>
Deploy the sample application using kubectl:

kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

>
Verify pods and deployments

kubectl get pod,deployment

>>
3: Manually perform Horizontal Scaling

To manually scale the number of replicas for the sample application, run the following command:

kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3

deployment.apps/nginx-deployment scaled

>
This command increases the replica count to 3. To verify that the scaling operation was successful, run:

kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pod -w

>
Verify that the number of pods has increased:

kubectl get pod


>>
4: Manually perform Vertical Scaling

To manually scale the resources allocated to each replica, edit the yaml file and modify the limits and requests sections:

Edit the deployment to increase the resources allocated to each container. 
Edit the nginx-deployment.yaml file to include resource requests and limits:

I have increased memory requested and memory limit:

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "128Mi"


>
Apply the changes to the deployment:

kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

>
Verify that the resources have been updated by running:

kubectl get deployments nginx-deployment -o yaml


Look for the updated resources section in the output.
