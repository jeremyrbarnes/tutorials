Expose Nginx Service on EKS Cluster w/ Fargate using eksctl
----
>>
Create Nginx service yaml file or we can just run kubectl expose command.

Expose the Nginx deployment:
Run Command:
kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --type=LoadBalancer --name=nginx-service


Check the service to get the external IP:
Run Command:
kubectl get svc nginx-service

Once the external IP is available, you can access the Nginx web server by navigating to http://<External-IP> in your browser.

>
Can't see Web Page

If the external IP is available but you are not able to access the Nginx page, it's possible that there is a security group or networking configuration issue that is preventing access to the service.

It is generally required Ingress With Cert-Manager

Check Access within the Cluster: 
Run a temporary pod with curl installed, and use it to send an HTTP request to the Nginx service. 

Run Command:
kubectl run -i --tty --rm debug --image=radial/busyboxplus:curl --restart=Never -- curl nginx-service

This command runs a temporary pod with the radial/busyboxplus:curl image, which has curl installed, sends an HTTP request to the Nginx service, and then removes the pod once you exit.

If everything is configured correctly, you should see the HTML content of the Nginx welcome page as output in your terminal.
