Applying Changes - terraform apply: Create infrastructure:

Apply the configuration now with the terraform apply command. 
Terraform will print output include information about infra creation.

Run Command:
terraform apply

Before it applies any changes, Terraform prints out the execution plan which describes the actions Terraform will take in order to change your infrastructure to match the configuration.

The output format is similar to the diff format generated by tools such as Git. 
The output has a + next to aws_instance.app_server, meaning that Terraform will create this resource.
