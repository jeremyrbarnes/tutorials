Create a sample deployment and expose it on port 8080:
  kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=mehmetozkaya/productservice:latest
  kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080


>Check service
The easiest way to access this service is to let minikube launch a web browser for you:
	kubectl get services hello-minikube

	minikube service hello-minikube

SEE - WORKED !
http://127.0.0.1:62162/api/products
[{"id":1,"name":"Product A","price":12.99},{"id":2,"name":"Product B","price":23.99},{"id":3,"name":"Product C","price":34.99}]

>
Alternatively, use kubectl to forward the port:
	kubectl port-forward service/hello-minikube 7080:8080

Your application is now available at http://localhost:7080/.
