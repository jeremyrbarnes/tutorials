Create Ingress for External Access of Product Microservice
----
No longer need a service type of LoadBalancer since the service does not need to be accessible from the internet. 
It only needs to be accessible from the Ingress Controller (internal to the cluster) 
  so we can change the service type to ClusterIP.

Update your service.yaml file to look like this:

    Remove type
    Create Ingress into product.yaml file

We have created Ingress object and referring to our service object which is product-service.
and host address is product.local

>
So we should add this dns address into our host file.

Update your hosts file (/etc/hosts on Linux and macOS or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows) to add the following line:

First get IP of minikube
minikube ip
192.168.49.2

>
Add this line:

# Added by Minikube Custom Domain
192.168.49.2 product.local

>>
Now we are ready to deploy our ingress.
But before that we should active Ingress addons into our minikube installment.

See all list
	minikube addons list

Activate Ingress for our local minikube
	minikube addons enable ingress

>>
Re-apply the app service manifest.
Re-create all objects:

kubectl delete -f product.yaml
kubectl apply -f product.yaml

> See all
kubectl get all

kubectl get ingress
NAME              CLASS   HOSTS           ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
product-ingress   nginx   product.local   192.168.49.2   80      3m29s

>
Access dns adress

product.local

>
SEE RESULT:
http://product.local/api/products
[{"id":1,"name":"Product A","price":12.99},{"id":2,"name":"Product B","price":23.99},{"id":3,"name":"Product C","price":34.99}]
