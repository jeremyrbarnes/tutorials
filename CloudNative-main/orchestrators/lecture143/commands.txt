Scale a Container Instance in Kubernetes
----
Start with watch pods
	kubectl get pod -w

Use the kubectl scale command to update the deployment with a number of pods to create.
	kubectl scale --replicas=5 deployment/product

>
See watch - new 2 pod creating
product-deploy-5d5ccb7569-khfs6   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
product-deploy-5d5ccb7569-qkrzn   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s

	kubectl get pod

>>
if there's a failure Kubernetes will automatically restart the pods that were running before the failure.
Let's see this resilience in action by deleting pod and then verifying that Kubernetes has restarted it.

kubectl get pods
product-deploy-5d5ccb7569-khfs6   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s
product-deploy-5d5ccb7569-qkrzn   0/1     ContainerCreating   0          0s

>
Delete the pod by using the kubectl delete command. 
  kubectl delete pod product-5b6cc765c4-hjpx4

>see
immediately stating the pod has been deleted.
  kubectl get pods

random string following the pod name has changed. 
Indicating the pod is a new instance.

>>
To scale the instance back down, run the following command.

	kubectl scale --replicas=1 deployment/product

Both of these approaches modify the running configuration 
  manually run kubectl scale
  or change replica number.

Solution: Auto-Scaling
