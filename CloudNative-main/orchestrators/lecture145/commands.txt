Clean up resources
----
>1
Delete host address
	C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts

>2	
	kubectl delete deployment my-app
	kubectl delete service my-app-service
	kubectl delete pod my-app-pod
	kubectl delete ingress my-app-ingress

Since we can't just delete the pods, we have to delete the deployments.
	kubectl delete -f ./product.yaml

Finally, stop Minikube with the command:
	minikube stop
