create "addons" folder under lecture folder  on vscode

copy paste all items into github to vs code folder
	https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/release-1.17/samples/addons

	kiali.yaml
	prometheus.yaml
	jaeger.yaml
	grafana.yaml

> Read
	Readme File

>
goto path
	copy and paste addons folder of k8s

>
Examine files
	kiali.yaml
	prometheus.yaml
	jaeger.yaml
	grafana.yaml

So now we are ready to apply this whole folder into our minikube kubernetes cluster over the istio service mesh.

Waiting for deployment "kiali" rollout to finish: 0 of 1 updated replicas are available...
