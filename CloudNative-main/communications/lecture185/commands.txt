Re-run the previous command and wait until all pods report READY and STATUS Running before you go to the next step. This might take a few minutes depending on your platform.

Make sure that 2/2 pods created successfully.

Verify everything is working correctly up to this point. 
Run this command to see if the app is running inside the cluster and serving HTML pages by checking for the page title in the response:

bash script

$ kubectl exec "$(kubectl get pod -l app=ratings -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')" -c ratings -- curl -sS productpage:9080/productpage | grep -o "<title>.*</title>"

<title>Simple Bookstore App</title>
